#summary DWScript Source Code Structure.

== Source Structure ==

DWScript supports two source structure styles: Script/Mixed-Mode and Classic Unit/Program.

=== Script / Mixed-Mode ===

Code structure is essentially standard Pascal with the following specificities:
 * variables, constants and procedures can be declared inline.
 * begin/end is optional for main program code.
 * var, const and type keywords have to be explicit before any var or type declaration in the main program (var/const blocks are allowed in procedure, before the first begin).
 * methods can be implemented inline (in the class declaration).

Variables are guaranteed to always be initialized.

Variable declaration can feature an assignment, variable type can be inferred, for instance
{{{
var i := 20;
}}}
is equivalent to
{{{
var i : Integer;
i:=20;
}}}
as well as
{{{
var i : Integer := 20;
}}}
