#summary DWScript Classes

== Classes ==

Classes all derive from the root TObject class and follow the classic Delphi syntax. They're reference types, see also [Records].

Named constructors are supported, as well as class methods, meta-classes, virtual methods, properties and destructors. Properties can optionally be array properties, and can feature an explicit index.

Visibilities are private, protected, public and published.

Classes can implement [Interfaces].

You can also declare class methods with "method" as in the Oxygene language, in addition to "procedure" and "function".
