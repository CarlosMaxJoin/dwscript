# DWScript Static Arrays

== Static Arrays ==

Static arrays are supported as value types, they have a fixed size with user-specified bounds:

{{{
type TZeroToTen = array [0..10] of Integer;
type TTenToTwenty = array [10..20] of String;
}}}

Multi-dimensional arrays are supported, with two forms:

{{{
type TCompactForm = array [1..3, 1..5] of Float;
type TVerboseForm = array [1..3] of array [1..5] of Float;
}}}

They support the special functions/methods Low, High and Length. You can use them as either functions (legacy) or methods _Low(array)_ and _array.Low_ are equivalent.

You can use the *in* and *not in* operators to test the presence of an element in a static array.
