#summary Loop Control statements.

== Loop Control ==

Four forms of loops are supported:

 * [ForInDo for in do] : loop on elements in a sequence
 * [ForToDo for to/downto do] : loop on an integer variable
 * [RepeatUntil repeat until] : loop on a final condition
 * [WhileDo while do] : loop on an initial condition

All these loops can also be controlled by the following statements:

 * *`break`* : exits the current loop
 * *`continue`* : jump to the next iteration of loop

Note that *`break`* and *`continue`* are statements and [ReservedNames reserved names]. They're not functions like in classic Delphi.
It means that they're always and _unambiguously_ loop control instructions, and can't be overloaded by user functions or variables.

The [exit] statement will also exit a loop as well as the whole function.
