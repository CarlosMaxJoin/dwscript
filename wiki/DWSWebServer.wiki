= Introduction =

DWScript WebServer is based on http.sys 2.0 and requires under Windows 2008, Vista or above.

= Built-in features =

Serves a directory as www root, by default the www folder in the directory where the executable is configured, though that can be changed.

In that directory:
* all files with the ".dws" extensions will be processed as scripts
* all folders or file whose name starts with '.' are hidden and won't be served (if queried, the error will be 404)
* other files that are present will be served "as they are"
* when a directory is queried, server will serve index.dws, index.htm or index.html (first present, in that order)

Deflate compression will be applied if the client browser accepts it for text files (mime types "text/*" and selected "application/*") larger than 1024 bytes.
