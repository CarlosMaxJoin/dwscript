#summary String (base type)

=== String ===

Strings can be delimited by a single *'* or a double-quote *"*.

In a single-quoted string, a single quote can be expressed by doubling it.<br>
In a double-quoted string, a double-quote can be expressed by doubling it. Double-quoted strings can span multiple lines.

Explicit Unicode characters can be specified by using # followed by an integer codepoint (decimal or hexadecimal). Characters specified this way are always understood as Unicode codepoint.

{{{
Print('Hello'#13#$0D'World');
}}}

Will print 'Hello' followed by CR+LF (ASCII code 13 and 10), followed by 'World', it can also be defined with

{{{
Print("Hello
World");
}}}

Finally indented strings can also be defined with #" or #', the compiler will then ignore common indentation, and will additionally ignore an empty first line, so you can also write

{{{
Print(#"
   Hello
   World");
}}}
