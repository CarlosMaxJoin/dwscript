#summary DWScript base types

== Base Types ==

The following types are standard:
 * *[BaseTypes#Integer Integer]* : 64bit signed integer
 * *[BaseTypes#Float Float]* : double-precision floating-point
 * *[BaseTypes#Boolean Boolean]* : True/False
 * *[String]* : mutable, copy-on-write, 1-based, UTF-16 string

The following types are optional:
 * Variant
 * COM support : OleVariant, ComVariant, ComVariantArray
 * RttiVariant : specializable interface to Delphi Rtti types
 * TComplex : double-precision complex numbers (dwsMathComplexFunctions)
 * Vector : double-precision 4D homogeneous vector (dwsMath3DFunctions)
 * Vector : double-precision 4D matrix (dwsMath3DFunctions)

== Literals/Constants ==

=== Integer ===

Decimal notation: 123, -456

Hexadecimal notation: $1AF or 0x1AF

Binary notation: 0b10011101

For formatting purposes, the underscore '`_`' character is accepted (and ignored) in Hexadecimal and Binary literals.

=== Float ===

Presence of a '.' differentiates from an Integer.

Normal notation: 45.2304

Exponential notation: 1.256e23

=== Boolean ===

Possible values are _*True*_ and _*False*_, case insensitive.

When casting a Boolean as Integer, by convention _True_ maps to 1, _False_ maps to 0.

When casting an Integer as Boolean, 0 maps to _False_, all other values map to _True_.
