#summary Defined() Special function.

== Defined() ==

This [SpecialFunctions special function] has the following forms:

{{{
function Defined( string_value ) : Boolean;
}}}
Indicates if the conditional whose name is specified by the string is defined.

 * When used in a conditional directive, its value is evaluated for the code that has already been parsed up to the point where the directive is encountered.
 * When used in code, its value is evaluated at runtime, and depends on the conditionals still active at that point.

{{{
function Defined( value_of_type_external_class ) : Boolean;
}}}
Indicates if the value is defined, depending on execution context it could mean "empty" or "undefined", if such a value exists and is distinct from nil/null.
