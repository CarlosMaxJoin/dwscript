#summary DWScript Memory Model

= Memory Model =

A garbage collector ensures that no script-objects or structures are leaked, however, invoking destructors explicitly on object is supported.

Once an object has been destroyed, further attempts to access it or its methods will fail with a guaranteed exception and is considered "safe" (no memory corruption can occur).

Destroying objects can be used to release memory of large objects immediately.
