#summary DWScript Dynamic Arrays

== Dynamic Arrays ==

See also [StaticArrays static arrays].

Dynamic arrays are supported as reference types, they are declared without bounds. Their Low bounds is always zero.

In addition to Low, High and Length, they also support the following pseudo-methods:
 * SetLength : defines the length of a dynamic array
 * Add/Push : increases Length by one and adds an item at the end of the array.
 * Delete : deletes the item at the specified index and reduces Length by one.
 * IndexOf : returns the index of an item, returns a negative value if not found.
 * Swap : swaps to items of specified indexes.
 * Reverse : reverses the order of the items.
  
You can use the *in* and *not in* operators to test the presence of an element in a static array.
