#summary DWScript Dynamic Arrays

== Dynamic Arrays ==

See also [StaticArrays static arrays].

Dynamic arrays are supported as reference types, they are declared without bounds. Their lower bound is always zero.

In addition to *`Low`*, *`High`* and *`Length`*, they also support the following pseudo-methods:
 * *`Add`*(item) / *Push*(item) : increases Length by one and adds an item at the end of the array.
 * *`Clear`*() : empties the array (equivalent to `SetLength`(0))
 * *`Copy`*(startIndex`[`, count`]`) : creates a new dynamic array containing coun items from startIndex, if count isn't specified, copies to the end of the array.
 * *`Delete`*(index) : deletes the item at the specified index and reduces Length by one.
 * *`IndexOf`*(item) : returns the index of an item, returns a negative value if not found.
 * *`SetLength`*(newLength) : defines the length of a dynamic array
 * *`Swap`*(index1, index2) : swaps to items of specified indexes.
 * *`Reverse`*() : reverses the order of the items.
  
You can use the *in* and *not in* operators to test the presence of an element in a static array.
